Ultracold polar molecules are an exciting new platform for quantum technologies. The combination of rich internal structure of vibration and rotation, controllable long-range dipole-dipole interactions and strong coupling to applied electric and microwave fields has inspired many applications. These include sensitive imaging of electromagnetic fields, quantum simulation of strongly interacting many-body systems, the study of quantum magnetism, quantum metrology and molecular clocks and quantum computation.

In Durham, we study ultracold ground-state RbCs molecules formed by associating Rb and Cs atoms using a combination of magnetoassociation and STIRAP [1]. This talk will report our progress on controlling the molecules for applications in quantum technology. Specifically, we will discuss how we have mastered the ac Stark shift due to the trapping light [2] to demonstrate robust storage qubits in the molecule [3] and will describe the development of magic traps that support long rotational coherences [4]. Finally, we will describe new experiments that produce single molecules in optical tweezers starting from a single Rb and a single Cs atom [5]. Together these results demonstrate the key elements of a quantum processor based upon ultracold RbCs molecules.
