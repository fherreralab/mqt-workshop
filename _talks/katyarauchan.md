Understanding the mechanisms that determine spin-lattice T1 relaxation times for molecular spin qubits in metal-organic framework (MOF) crystals is critical for near-term applications in precision measurements and quantum information processing [1]. Recent spin-echo experiments on the spin relaxation of vanadyl-based qubits as a function of magnetic field and temperature has stimulated the development of phenomenological and ab-initio quantum mechanical modeling techniques [1-3]. We propose a semi-empirical approach for building Redfield quantum master equations based on a stochastic fluctuation model for the molecular gyromagnetic tensor due to the interaction of molecular spin impurities with crystal lattice vibrations. The spin relaxation rates are obtained from a semi-empirical bath autocorrelation function that captures the experimental temperature dependence through a fitting procedure. These model spectral densities are used for computing the spin population and decoherence dynamics of vanadyl-based spin qubits beyond cryogenic temperatures (>50 K) and high magnetic fields, where vibrational Raman fluctuations and the Zeeman effect dominate the relaxation dynamics. Our results quantitatively agree with experiments [3] and represent a solid foundation for the theoretical characterization of other spin qubits in MOFs, for the rational design of novel quantum magnetometers based on this material class.
