Ultracold molecules offer an exciting prospect for the future of Quantum Science and Technology. In this talk I will focus on laser cooling of molecules, which twenty years ago was considered an impossibility. To build an experimental platform capable of applied quantum science we need to fulfil various criteria, notably, cold, trapped molecules in programable internal states, with strong controllable interactions. I will share the progress that we, as a community, have made and the vision for the future.
