Spins provide one of the simplest platforms to encode a quantum bit (qubit), the elementary unit of future quantum computers. A challenge in this topic is to control the quantum decoherence in these spin qubits by minimizing the sources of decoherence (dipolar spin-spin interactions, hyperfine interactions and spin-phonon interactions). This loss of quantum information by interaction with the environment can be quantified by the phase memory time T2. Here, I will show how a molecular approach can be exploited to design robust molecular quantum spin systems [1] showing enhanced decoherence, allowing to control the spin state through an external electric field [2], or hosting more than one spin qubit in order to implement quantum logic gates [3].
