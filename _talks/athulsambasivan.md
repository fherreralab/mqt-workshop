Near-resonant molecule-field interactions have attracted significant attention in chemical
physics and quantum optics [1,2]. We study the quantum dynamics of a molecular vibration
coupled to near-field modes of an infrared nanoresonator using macroscopic quantum
electrodynamics (QED). Nanophotonic structures vary in geometry and material properties,
which makes the calculations of interaction dynamics challenging [3]. We use the
electromagnetic Green’s tensor of the nanophotonic structure to construct frequency and
position dependent interaction Hamiltonians in macroscopic QED that are used to derive and
numerically solve the system of non-Markovian integro-differential equations (IDE) that
describe the dynamics of vibrational and photonic degrees of freedom in strong coupling.
The material and dipole parameters are encoded in the structure of the kernel function of the
IDE. We solve for photonic and vibrational observables for a single non-polar anharmonic
vibration in a resonant infrared nanocavity and compare the results with recent
phenomenological Markovian models developed for vibrational polaritons [4], to better
understand the reach and limitations of reduced Markovian quantum optics models to
describe currently available experiments.
