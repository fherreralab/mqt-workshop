**Single organic molecules in the solid-state are one of the promising optical platforms for realizing quantum networks owing to their remarkable coherent properties and flexibility in their chemical synthesis [1]. However, the molecular excited states associated with the strong Fourier-limited zero-phonon lines of these systems decay within nanoseconds, posing a challenge for practical applications in quantum technologies.**

**In this theoretical work, we propose a new molecular system with quantum coherences up to millisecond time scales. Here, we exploit the inherent optomechanical character of organic molecules in a solid organic crystal [2]. The proposed scheme consists of a single organic molecule in a host matrix with a structured phononic environment. By suppressing phononic decay channels, we realize and exploit long optomechanical coherence times up to milliseconds for storing and retrieving information. We show that the resulting long-lived vibrational states facilitate reaching the strong optomechanical regime at the single photon level. The proposed system shows the promise of organic molecules for achieving unexplored optomechanical phenomena and long-lived quantum memories.**
