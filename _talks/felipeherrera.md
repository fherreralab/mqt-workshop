Coherent light-matter interaction of molecular media in infrared (IR) cavities is a promising tool for manipulating and controlling chemical reactivity and light emission. We study the wavepacket dynamics of an individual hydrogen fluoride (HF) molecule in strongly-confined electromagnetic environments and show that in the absence of additional thermal or coherent external sources, a single-mode cavity vacuum can efficiently dissociate the molecule, when this is suddenly prepared in the vibrational ground level. We predict dissociation probabilities of up to 20% in less than 200 fs for a bare vacuum field that is resonant with the fundamental vibration frequency at the onset of the ultrastrong coupling regime. Further enhancements of the dissociation probability can be expected for a cavity with thermal excitations and multiple modes. We develop an analytical model for understanding these results using polaron transformation techniques on the multi-level quantum Rabi model of vibrational polaritons. The model highlights the importance of Bloch-Seigert shifts of the vibrational levels and the role permanent dipole moments in the light-matter coupling process. This work highlights the fundamental differences that can be expected for reactive dynamics in infrared cavities and plasmonic nanostructures in comparison with free space chemistry.
