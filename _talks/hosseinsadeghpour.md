Cold Rydberg atoms are the Swiss-army knife for engineering precise quantum interactions in atomic and molecular systems. I will describe how elementary Rydberg interactions in the quantum limit can lead to the emergence of few-body and the many-body collective phenomena in ultracold degenerate gases and how they may be exploited to simulate indirect quantum magnetization, such as chiral interaction, with Rydberg atoms as delocalized impurities.
