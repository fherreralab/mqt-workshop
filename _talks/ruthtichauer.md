While the complex internal dynamics as well as the immediate material environment of
organic chromophores limit their coherent emission and transport properties, coupling
these photoactive molecules to nanophotonic structures has the potential to open a new
era in energy harvesting [1], transport [2,3], and information processing [4,5]. In the
strong light-matter coupling regime, the large binding energy of Frenkel excitons makes
organic materials promising candidates for future applications as polariton formation
takes place at ambient conditions.
However, a model that describes accurately both the molecules and the electromagnetic
environment created by the light-confining structure is currently lacking which limits the
understanding of the effects of material properties in the dynamics of strongly coupled
systems. While we have achieved the first requirement of such a model by adopting an
atomistic QM/MM representation of the material part of the strongly coupled system
[6,7], the description of confined light was limited to modes of optical Fabry-Pérot
resonators [8]. To move beyond, we introduce an explicit description of the quantised
electromagnetic field for arbitrary nanophotonic structures such as plasmonic or hybrid
metallodieletric nanocavities [9]. In the talk, I will present the model and share ongoing
work aimed at investigating the properties of a few chromophores strongly coupled to a
plasmonic nanocavity [10].
