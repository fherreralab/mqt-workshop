In this talk, I will present theoretical and computational approaches to describe excited-states in quantum
matter, and predicting emergent states created by external drives. Understanding the role of such light-
matter interactions in the regime of correlated electronic systems is of paramount importance to fields of
study across condensed matter physics, quantum optics, and ultrafast dynamics 1. The simultaneous
contribution of processes that occur on many time and length-scales have remained elusive for state-of-
the-art calculations and model Hamiltonian approaches alike, necessitating the development of new
methods in computational chemistry. I will discuss our work at the intersection of ab initio cavity
quantum-electrodynamics and electronic structure methods to treat electrons, photons and phonons on the
same quantized footing, accessing new observables in strong light-matter coupling. Current
approximations in the field almost exclusively focus on electronic excitations, neglecting electron-photon
effects, for example, thereby limiting the applicability of conventional methods in the study of polaritonic
systems, which requires understanding the coupled dynamics of electronic spins, nuclei, phonons and
photons. With our approach we can access correlated electron-photon and photon-phonon dynamics 2–6 ,
essential to our latest work on driving quantum materials far out-of-equilibrium to control the coupled
electronic and vibrational degrees-of-freedom 7–13 . In the second part of my talk, I will demonstrate how
the same approach can be generalized in the context of control of molecular quantum matter and
molecular quantum transduction. As a first example, I will discuss a cavity-mediated approach to break
the inversion symmetry allowing for highly tunable even-order harmonic generation (e.g. second- and
fourth-harmonic generation) naturally forbidden in such systems. This relies on a quantized treatment of
the coupled light-matter system, similar to the driven case, where the molecular matter is confined within
an electromagnetic environment and the incident (pump) field is treated as a quantized field in a coherent
state (with just a few photons). When the light-molecule system is strongly coupled, it leads to two
important features: (i) a controllable strong-coupling-induced symmetry breaking, and (ii) a tunable and
highly efficient nonlinear conversion efficiency of the harmonic generation processes 14–17 . Both of these
have implications for molecular quantum architectures. Being able to control molecules at a quantum
level gives us access to degrees of freedom such as the vibrational or rotational degrees to the internal
state structure. Finally, I will give an outlook on connecting ideas in cavity control of molecules with
quantum information science.
