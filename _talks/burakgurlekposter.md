Laboratory manipulation of single quantum emitters and single photons has matured to a routine procedure over the past two decades [1]. These activities have led to new emerging topics such as optomechanical functionalities and coherent cooperative interactions among several quantum emitters. In this presentation, we discuss our efforts of the last decade in coupling molecules to high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavities [2] and nanoscopic waveguides on a chip [3], demonstrating dipole-induced transparency, strong coupling and single-photon nonlinearity. Moreover, we present data on precision spectroscopy of the vibronic transitions in single molecules and related coherent effects [4]. We also show the latest results on the coupling of two or molecules to each other via a common mode of a micro-resonator.
