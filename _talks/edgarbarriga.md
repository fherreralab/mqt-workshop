Degeneracies in molecular systems have been studied extensively in the last decades. This kind of singularity has profound impacts on the dynamics since non-adiabatic effects arise due to the coupling between the electronic and nuclear motion [1]. For a N-state system the non-crossing rule requires a (N-1)(N+2)/2 conditions over internal coordinates to achieve a degeneracy point in configuration space. Despite this seemingly strong restriction conical intersections of more than two states have shown to be not just a curiosity but the rule [2]. The existence of degeneracies is not restricted to the field-free case. It has been shown that they can be created by external means [3,4]. 

In this work we show that by using a bichromatic radiation field a three-state degeneracy can be created in diatomic molecules. This situation is forbidden for field-free diatomic molecules due to the non-crossing rule. The threefold degeneracy comes along with novels kind of two-state intersections (also forbidden for field-free diatomic molecules). We study the effects of the polarization of the lasers in these different induced intersections between the potential energy surfaces. The system chosen is the Cs$_2$ molecule.

The time-dependent Hamiltonian is treated with the Many Mode Floquet Theory (MMFT) [5]. We use the MMFT formalism to calculate the long-time averaged transition probabilities. We found a non-trivial dependence of the relative phase in this observable. Our results establish a way that can be implemented experimentally to control the non-adiabatic dynamics in molecular systems through the relative phase.
