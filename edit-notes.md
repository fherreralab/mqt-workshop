2nd Workshop on Molecular Quantum Technology (MQT) (Bigger)
December 12-16, 2022. Puerto Natales, Chile. (less big)

MQT 2022 in-person workshop that will bring together leading scientists across
disciplines to discuss fundamental science and applications in which
molecules and molecular materials can contribute to the development of
quantum technology in novel ways, as well as closely related topics. 

The first edition of this workshop was held in 2019 (http://mqt2019.org),
attracting a very engaging group of renowned scientists and early career
researchers across physics, chemistry and materials science sharing a common
interest in this emerging area of interdisciplinary quantum research.
